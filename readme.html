<h1>Sanity Check</h1>
<p>
   The Sanity Add-On is intended to demonstrate basic field data access.  It allows a user to configure a list of
   microblock display names that have interesting values along with minimum and maximum expected values.  It can then
   perform a a basic sanity check to look for any current values outside of the specified ranges.  This may be useful
   finding problems like open or shorted sensors.
</p>
<h2>Try it out</h2>
<p>
   Deploy the Sanity sample add-on by executing the 'deploy' task and starting (if necessary) the server.
</p>
<p>
   Browse to <span class="examp">http://yourserver/sanity</span> (<a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/sanity">open on localhost</a>).
   This should present a login page.  Log in with any valid operator and password.
</p>
<p>
   Add some values to check.  Fill in some display names (like &quot;Zone Temp&quot;), minimum, and maximum values,
   then click the &quot;Add&quot; button.
</p>
<p>
   Fill in a location (reference name path below the geographic root - like &quot;<span class="examp">building200/floor_1</span>&quot;)
   and press the &quot;Run&quot; button to run the report from the specified location.
   If you leave the location blank, it will run from the root of the Geographic tree.
</p>
<p>

<h2>Important Lessons</h2>
<p>
   The <span class="examp">Controller.java</span> file is the entry point for most of the interesting parts of this sample.
   All requests for server side action are sent to this class.
   The <span class="examp">doRun</span> method runs this &quot;report&quot;, using a ReadAction to find PresentValue aspects,
   retrieve their current value from the field, and compare it to stored limits.
</p>
<p>
   <span class="examp">SanityCheckConfig</span>'s <span class="examp">load</span> and <span class="examp">save</span> methods
   use <a target="_blank" href="../../docs/javadoc/index.html?com/controlj/green/addonsupport/access/DataStore.html">DataStores</a>
   to read and write the configuration information.
